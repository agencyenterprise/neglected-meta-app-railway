Do token calculation on how much it would cost for all articles
TF-IDF...

"Big if True" genesmith.


Making the call cheaper, for tomorrow!!!
1 for high quality and then 1 for neglected
do the neglected first and then quality.

Ask Bodgan for a bunch of neglected ideas. Now tell me 10 more...

1. Separate the similarity stuff... Things might not be in the right style and therefore ignored
2. Explore some of the directions as we have now and find 3 ways through neglected that get us the top 5 concepts.
3. classify on big if true stuff
4. plattitudes. "Encourage everyone to take step" - Saying things without actually saying anything.
5. 


Then start implementing TF-IDF and Token
